I used DeepSeek. I started by giving it simply the requirements, then told it to form a plan for the uml before writing it so i could update it,  then approved it to make the uml after reminding it to follow solid design principles. 
First Prompt was exactly the Problem description

Second Prompt was: " this looks great, i am going to make a uml diagram in mermaid. would you help me with this? why don't we start by first having you go through what you think this should be composed of,
much like you do for deep research, allowing me to view the plan and make tweaks before actually making the UML code." 

Third Prompt was: "i like this, you should be good to make the code, make sure to remember the SOLID design principles and use design patterns when possible"
